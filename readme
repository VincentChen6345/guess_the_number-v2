This game project was designed by Jonas Schmetmann for his Udemy course "
The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!". I decided to rebuild the project using CSS grid and attempt to implement the JavaScript logic on my own with only the help of  Google. I'm proud to say that I have successfully done so and now I  truly understand the basics of DOM manipulation.
